def median_of_two_sorted_arrays
    # This is my solution and it is O((n+m) * log(n+m)) - they want us to solve in O(log(n+m))
    
    # Adding two arrays in ruby is O(n+m) time - the reason for this is that
    # behind the scenes, arrays can only hold the number of items you give it.
    # If you want to add more items, ruby will need to copy all the elements into a new
    # memory location that can fit the extended array. So when you add two arrays together, 
    # ruby is copying the elements of both arrays into another location.
    # Ruby arrays are what's known as dynamic array - in languages like javascript and python the arrays are also dynamic
    # but if you were to use a lower level language like java (although there is also a dynamic array in java) or c++, 
    #you'd need to specify how many elements you want the array to have before you give it any elements and if you want more 
    # elements in that array, you'd need to copy all elements into a new array with a new size.

    #The sorting takes O(log(n+m)) since behind the scenes ruby uses quick sort algorithm which takes O(log(n+m))
